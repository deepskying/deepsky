# üëèWelcom to use deepsky-note üëè
I have long been searching for an editor capable of handling large-scale document editing with both richness and freedom in content creation. Unfortunately, throughout years of writing, I never quite found such a tool. So I decided to design one myself‚Äîan editor that would meet all these needs and serve as the ultimate home for the notes I‚Äôve accumulated over the years.
And now, it‚Äôs here. I‚Äôm thrilled to share it with you.
