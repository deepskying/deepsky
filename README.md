# Welcom to use deepsky-note 👏👏👏
I have long been searching for an editor capable of handling large-scale document editing with both richness and freedom in content creation. Unfortunately, throughout years of writing, I never quite found such a tool. So I decided to design one myself—an editor that would meet all these needs and serve as the ultimate home for the notes I’ve accumulated over the years.
And now, it’s here. I’m thrilled to share it with you.
